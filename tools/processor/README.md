## Tools: Processor

[Kotlin Symbol Processing](https://github.com/google/ksp) (KSP) processors are defined in this module, which process
user code in order to generate various runtime app implementations and metadata. KSP processors produce material which
is used by other parts of the Elide app build pipeline, including the SSG (Static Site Generator) builder and the app
bundler.
