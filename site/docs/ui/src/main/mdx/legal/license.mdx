Elide the library, and Elide the runtime, are both licensed under the [MIT license][1]. Various components of Elide are
[licensed separately](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide/blob/v3/LICENSES.txt).

<br />

#### About the MIT license

The MIT license is known as one of the most permissive open source licenses. If you are embedding Elide, or using Elide
as a library, you are not obligated in any way to make your own code open source, but you _are_ obligated to include
Elide's license information within your own project (read more about this in the [license itself][1]).

[choosealicense.com][2] also has a good overview of the MIT license. **Note that no provision or writing here, on the
licensing page, overrides or modifies the terms of the license itself, and does not constitute legal advice.** If you
are concerned about the legal implications using open source software in your project, consult an attorney.
