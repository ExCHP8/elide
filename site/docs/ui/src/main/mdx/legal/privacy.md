Elide collects anonymous usage data in various circumstances. These collection mechanisms are documented exhaustively

##### Data collection

Elide collects data in the following circumstances:

- **When you browse this website.** Anonymous (and de-identified) analytics are sent for each page-view, which help us
  understand if the website is useful, and if so, to whom. This data is sent to Google Analytics via Google Tag Manager.

  If you prefer to opt-out of this data collection, click the _gear icon_ in the bottom right of any page, and check the
  opt-out switch.

  Alternatively, simply opt-out when first presented with the cookie and analytics consent prompt.

- **When you install Elide on a computer.** Depending on how you install Elide (in particular, via the one-line
  installer, or any route serviced by Elide's domain), Elide may set a cookie on your machine. This cookie is used to
  calculate a rough count of unique downloads, which helps us understand how many real humans are using Elide.

  We understand this metric is fuzzy, and this data is not used any other way; the cookie value used is a random UUID
  generated on the user's machine, and stored at the location `~/.elide/.host_id`.

  If you prefer to opt-out of this data collection, you can delete the cookie file at `~/.elide/.host_id` after
  finishing installation.
