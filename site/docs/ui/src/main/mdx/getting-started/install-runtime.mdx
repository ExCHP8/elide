### Using Elide as a Runtime

Installing Elide on your machine is easy. Pick one of the installation methods below.

##### One-line installer

> Supported platforms at this time are `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`, and `linux-amd64`.

The one-line installer is a Bash script which installs the latest CLI version for your machine's architecture. The
script is customizable, and defaults to installing the binary in `~/bin` and updating your `PATH` if needed:

```bash
curl -sSL --tlsv1.2 dl.elide.dev/cli/install.sh | bash -s -
```
