_**Elide is under construction. You can also browse to [`v2`][12] or [`v1`][11].**_

<hr />

Elide is **Kotlin/Multiplatform meta-framework** for **rapid, cross-platform application development**. Write once in
Kotlin and deploy everywhere: your server, the browser, and native app targets.


### What do you mean by _meta-framework_?

Elide could be characterized as a _meta-framework_ in the sense that it is powered entirely by mature and well-supported
software under the hood. Via a thin combination of build tooling and runtime interfaces, the developer can
leverage these tools together without worrying about performance or compatibility.


#### Cross-platform features

- **Primitives.** Access the entire [Kotlin Standard Library](), with additional extensions and a the full suite of
  [KotlinX]() extensions, including [`serialization`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html),
  [`atomicfu`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.atomicfu),
  [`coroutines`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines), and
  [`datetime`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-datetime).

- **Logging.** Use an identical interface across platforms, which calls into the best layer available for that system.
  For example, on the JVM, logging calls into `slf4j`, and in JavaScript, `console.*`.

- **Observability.** Generate uniform logs across platforms, which correlate and provide a fully observable picture of
  application behavior.

- **Data modeling.** Express data models once, with support for databasing, serialization/de-serialization, and data
  exchange via RESTful APIs, gRPC, or gRPC-Web.


## Distinguishing features

- **Native development with Kotlin.** Write your core application logic and models once, and share them across platforms
  transparently. Leverage [Kotest](https://kotest.io) for cross-platform write-once-run-everywhere testing.

- **Isomorphic SSR with React.** Write your UI in React, using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Kotlin. Package it for serving
  via [client-side rendering or hybrid isomorphic rendering](https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/) directly from your
  Kotlin server.

- **Transparent API services with gRPC.** Cross-service AOP with
  [gRPC Dekorator](https://github.com/mottljan/grpc-dekorator), with the native ability to serve data to native clients
  via raw [gRPC][6] or native [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web).

- **Model-driven development.** Write your models once, and use them everywhere, across platforms, **without copying**,
  **without glue-code**, and **without DTOs**. Via [Protobuf][5] and
  [Kotlin data classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html), the same Elide model is code-generated for use
  with your database, API, and UI.


## Code samples

A full suite of [code samples](./samples) demo various functionality. The samples are runnable locally or via pre-built
Docker images. Click through to each one for a short tour and getting started guide.

"Blah blah blah, okay, show me some code." Certainly:

**`App.kt`** (for the server)
```kotlin
/** GET `/`: Controller for index page. */
@Controller class Index {
  // Serve an HTML page with isomorphic React SSR.
  @Get("/") fun index() = ssr {
    head {
      title { +"Hello, Elide!" }
      stylesheet("/styles/main.css")
      script("/scripts/ui.js", defer = true)
    }
    body {
      injectSSR()
    }
  }

  // Serve styles for the page.
  @Get("/styles/main.css") fun styles() = css {
    rule("body") {
      backgroundColor = Color("#bada55")
    }
    rule("strong") {
      fontFamily = "-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif"
    }
  }

  // Serve the built & embedded JavaScript.
  @Get("/scripts/ui.js") fun js() = asset(
    "frontend.js",
    "js",
    MediaType("application/javascript", "js"),
  )
}
```

**`main.kt`** (for the browser)
```kotlin
// React props for a component
external interface HelloProps: Props {
  var name: String
}

// React component which says hello
val HelloApp = FC<HelloProps> { props ->
  div {
    strong {
      +props.name
    }
  }
}

// Entrypoint for the browser
fun main() {
  hydrateRoot(
    document.getElementById("root"),
    Fragment.create() {
      HelloApp {
        name = "Elide"
      }
    }
  )
}
```

That's it. That's the entire app. In fact, it's just the [`fullstack/react-ssr`](./samples/fullstack/react-ssr) sample
pasted into the README. What we get out of this is surprising:

- **Server:** JVM or Native server (via GraalVM) that serves our root page, our CSS, and our JS
- **Client:** Embedded JS VM that executes a Node copy of our React UI and splices it into the page for isomorphic rendering
- **For us** (the developer):
  - Completely type-checked calls across platforms, with almost no boilerplate
  - Single build graph, with aggressive caching and tool support
  - Build & test virtualized on any platform
  - Ship & perform natively on any platform


What's going on here? Elide has helped us wire together code from **Micronaut** (that's where `@Controller` comes from),
**Kotlin/JS**, **GraalVM**, and **esbuild** to make the above code make sense on both platforms. The React code builds
for the browser _and_ a pure server environment; both are embedded into the JAR and served through a thin runtime layer
provided by the framework.


#### That's not a big deal

If you're participating in the React and Java ecosystems, this gives you a fantastic best-of-both-worlds runtime option:
superb tooling support for React and Kotlin and an ideal serving and rendering mode, all handled for you.

You can do the same thing with these same tools in a custom codebase, but setting up the build environment for this kind
of app is challenging and error-prone. Elide _intentionally_ leverages existing frameworks with rich ecosystems and
docs, _instead of_ re-providing existing functionality so that you always have an escape hatch up to a more industrial
toolset if you need it.


### Powered-by

Elide is modular. You can mix and match the following technologies in **server**, **client**, or **hybrid/fullstack**
development scenarios:

- [**Kotlin**][1]. Elide is written from the inside out with support for Kotlin/Multiplatform, including native
  platforms. Write once and use the same consistent code across server-side and client-side(s) platforms.

- [**GraalVM**][2]. GraalVM is a JVM and toolchain from Oracle which includes modernized JIT support, cross-language
  [polyglot][10] development in JS, Ruby, Python, and LLVM, and the ability to build native binaries from JVM apps.

- [**Micronaut**][3]. Micronaut is a new JVM-based framework for building server-side applications. Elide leverages
  [Micronaut's](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#ioc)
  [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and
  [AOP](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#aop) features, and transparently works with most add-ons.

- [**React**][4]. React is a popular UI library written for browser and server environments. Elide leverages
  [Kotlin/JS support for React](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-get-started.html) for isomorphic UI rendering. CSR and
  SSR modes are supported natively.

- [**Protobuf**][5] / [**gRPC**][6]. Elide leverages cross-platform serialization through KotlinX's
  [`protobuf`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/formats.md#protobuf-experimental)
  module, and includes **native support for [gRPC Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web)** without running a proxy.
  Enforce API keys and traceability without [ESPv2](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/esp-v2).

- [**Closure**][7]. Use the Closure Tools family of software to develop performant and low-level JavaScript apps that
  are served directly from your application JAR. Render Soy templates server-side with Google's blazing-fast
  [Soy Sauce](https://github.com/google/closure-templates/blob/master/documentation/dev/adv-java.md) runtime, via
  pre-compiling templates to Java bytecode.

- [**Bazel**][8]. Built-in support for Bazel. Load directly from a tarball; build only what you use. Extensive suite of
  utility macros and rules.

- [**Gradle**][9]. Early support for building multi-platform Kotlin applications via Gradle, including integrated
  support for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)-based frontend builds and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)-based
  embedded SSR builds.

- [**PSOL**][10]. Early support for native integration with the
  [Pagespeed Optimization Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module), enabling on-the-fly
  optimization of server-side content.

- [**Buf**][13]. Planned support for shipping generated models to [BSR](https://docs.buf.build/bsr/overview), and
  integration with `buf lint` / `buf breaking`.


## Version compatibility

The following version matrix indicates tested support across tool and platform versions, including **Java**,
**Kotlin**, **GraalVM**, **Micronaut**, and **React**.

Following this guide is recommended but optional. Depending on the style of development you're doing with Elide, you may
not need some of these components:

| Status                                                          | **Java**      | **Kotlin** | **GraalVM** | **Micronaut** | **React** | **Protobuf/gRPC** |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-important) | **`Java 17`** | `1.7.0`    | `22.1.x`    | `3.5.x`       | `18.x`    | `3.20.1`/`1.46.0` |
| ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/-tested-success)         | `Java 11`     | `1.7.0`    | `22.1.x`    | `3.5.x`       | `18.x`    | `3.20.1`/`1.46.0` |

If you aren't using certain components on this list, for example, gRPC/Protobuf, you can ignore that column entirely.


## Platform Support

Elide itself generally supports any platform supported by GraalVM. This includes **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.
Client-side, all major browsers are supported, along with Android and iOS via Kotlin/Native.

Please consult the table below for a complete list of supported platforms and architectures:

| Build | OS             | Arch     | Libc   | Supported | Notes                  |

Bazel, Gradle, GraalVM, and Kotlin/Native must support a given platform for Elide to work across architectures.


## What about ...?

Two forms of this question typically come up from people new to Elide's style of development.

### **"What about [x] functionality that I want/need?"**

Java, and, by extension, Kotlin, has **one of the broadest and most active software ecosystems** on the planet, closely
followed by NodeJS, via NPM.

Elide supports both and allows you to access software written for both. Here are some examples to get you going.

- _I want to..._
  - **Server-side (Micronaut)**
    - ... localize my app: [Micronaut i18n](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/localized-message-source-gradle-kotlin.html)

    - ... authorize my users: [Micronaut Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/) (JWT, OAuth2, OIDC, LDAP, X.509)
    - ... build containers: compatibility with [Docker Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin), [`rules_docker`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker), and [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib)

  - **Build a mobile app**
    - (tbd)


### **"Why not just use [x] or [x + y]?"**

This question is another one that varies so much that it defies a stable answer. However, here are some common ones:

- **Why not just use Node?** Kotlin is _way_ faster at runtime, and the toolchain are broader and more robust.
- **Why not just use Micronaut?** You should. Micronaut is awesome. Elide is just a set of extensions on top of Micronaut. Feel free to use it directly or jump-start with Elide.
- **Why not just use Ktor?** Ktor is missing the ecosystem Micronaut has and is less compatible with GraalVM (for now).
- **Why not put these pieces together myself?** You totally can, and if you already want to try, you should consider contributing. It's a non-trivial endeavor, though.
- **Why develop on the JVM?** Consistency across dev machines, robust industry and ecosystem support, _really_ fast tooling, _full_ type checking. Coverage and reporting work great.
- **Why compile for native vs. ship on JVM?** Startup time is measured in `ms`. No JIT warmup = instant performance. Container replicas don't copy an entire JVM footprint.
- **Why not use Nashorn or Rhino?** Because they are slow and unlikely to get any better. GraalVM is fast, likely to get faster, and more likely to see updates.

## Cold Showers

Like any approach, Elide is not helpful in all situations and, at this time, **should be considered alpha-quality** for
use in production as a public release. Privately, Elide has undergone extensive use in production (see
_Adopters & history_ below). Even with perfect stability, though, you should consider these points before you pick this
stack:


#### Living on the bleeding edge can be painful

Kotlin/Multiplatform and GraalVM are still considered new technologies. You may encounter bugs or missing platform
support which can't easily be remedied. This is true of any young technology.


#### GraalVM's polyglot engine isn't insanely fast or stable yet

Many of the performance and stability issues here will resolve over time, but it's worth noting that using Elide in
isomorphic mode is new and may hit some of these issues. As a workaround, you can always switch back to CSR and _still_
beat an equivalent Node app to the TTFB punch.


#### Reflection can be a pain with native images

If you're compiling a native server binary, it can be a pain to mark reflection sites sufficiently to avoid runtime
errors. These pains are slowly improving with improved Micronaut code-gen support, but it's still a problem.


## About this framework

Elide has existed in different forms for over a decade. It was first released under the name `canteen` in 2011 as a
Python package. Later, the code evolved into Bazel/Java, then Bazel/Kotlin, and now Bazel/Gradle/Kotlin.

These frameworks were distinct from each other, written for a moment in time, but they shared authors, design patterns,
and goals:

- **The developer should have to write as little code as possible** without resorting to convention. Elide, in this way,
  is partly a reaction to the drawbacks of Rails-style architectures (and Next.js, which came much later).

- **If it builds, it should work.** As much as possible, type checking and code-gen should be leveraged where a human
  developer adds little or no value. Aligning types is a detailed and error-prone process, which is well suited for a
  computer.

- **A thing is just a thing. Not what is said of that thing.** Data is the effective king of runtime. An application's
  concepts should be strongly expressed as models, and the developer _should not have to repeat themselves_ across
  platforms to actualize or interchange expressions of those concepts.


### History


#### Adopters

Collectively, over a span of 10+ years, Elide has served millions of requests per month on behalf of the following
organizations (newest first):

- **[Cookies](https://cookies.co).** Elide powered all customer-facing digital properties, including the main Cookies
  site and e-commerce experience, with traffic reaching millions of users and unique hits per month.

- **[Bloombox](https://github.com/bloombox).** Elide powered the APIs underlying Bloombox's B2B retail application,
  scaling to millions of requests per month.

- **[Ampush](https://ampush.com).** Elide powered internal ad-tech systems at Ampush, which reached millions of events
  and requests per day.

- **[Keen IO](https://keen.io).** Elide powered the Keen website for a time, which reached millions of developers across
  the span of its early use in Python.



#### Timeline

- [2012] **`canteen`**: Leveraged Python meta-classes and cooperative greenlets after the release of
  [`gevent`](http://www.gevent.org/). "Holds more water than a [flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)." Inspired
  heavily by [`tipfy`](https://github.com/moraes/tipfy). Created at [Keen IO](https://keen.io) and adopted to run
  production systems at [Ampush Media](https://ampush.com).

- [2015]: **`gust`**: Written to integrate Kotlin with Bazel, ultimately with support for Soy, J2CL, Protobuf,
  and the Closure ecosystem of tools (via [`rules_closure`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure), shout out to
  @jart!). Powered production systems at Momentum Ideas and [Bloombox](https://github.com/bloombox).

- [2020]: **`gust` (`elide` v1)**: Rewritten in Java/Kotlin, with native support for Bazel, to continue `gust`'s
  evolution for production use at [Cookies](https://cookies.co).

- [2021]: **`elide` v2**: New model layer support with the addition of Redis, Firestore, and Spanner, to support the
  launch of [Cookies](https://cookies.co)' integrated e-commerce experience.

- [2022-now]: **`elide` v3**: Complete rewrite into pure Kotlin to leverage Kotlin Multiplatform, with native support
  for polyglot development via GraalVM, gRPC/Protobuf, and React. Build tooling support through Bazel and Gradle.
